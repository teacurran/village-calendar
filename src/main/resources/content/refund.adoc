== Refunds & Returns

Our calendars are custom-made to order. We offer refunds or replacements for:

* **Printing defects** - misprints, smudges, blurry images (not from low-res uploads)
* **Production errors** - wrong format, missing pages, incorrect layout
* **Shipping damage** - bent, torn, or water-damaged items

Refunds are not available for customer-provided errors or change of mind after printing.

== How to Request

Email **support@villagecompute.com** within 14 days of delivery with your order number and photos of the issue. We'll respond within 2-3 business days.

== Cancellations

Orders can be cancelled for a full refund before production starts (typically within 24 hours).
