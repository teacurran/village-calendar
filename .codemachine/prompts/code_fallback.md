# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create PaymentService for handling Stripe payment processing: createPayment (store Payment record linked to Order), processPaymentSuccess (on Stripe webhook, update Payment and Order status to PAID), processRefund (create refund via Stripe API, update Payment record). Implement StripeWebhookController (REST endpoint POST /api/webhooks/stripe) to receive Stripe webhook events: checkout.session.completed (payment succeeded), charge.refunded (refund processed). Add webhook signature validation to prevent spoofing. Implement idempotent webhook processing (handle duplicate webhook delivery). Enqueue email job on payment success (order confirmation email). Write integration tests for webhook handling.

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** `testWebhook_CheckoutSessionCompleted_UpdatesOrderStatus` - Order status remains PENDING instead of being updated to PAID
*   **Root Cause:** The webhook handler is successfully processing the payment and updating the order to PAID (confirmed by logs showing "Order d1c2c50f-981b-4abf-8a0e-dedeb1a82112 marked as PAID"), but the test is reading stale data. The `@Transactional` annotation on the WebhookResource endpoint causes the transaction to commit AFTER the HTTP response is sent. When the test immediately queries CalendarOrder.findById() after receiving the 200 OK response, the transaction might not have committed yet, so it reads the old PENDING status.

---

## Best Approach to Fix

The issue is a **transaction timing problem** in the test, NOT in the production code. The PaymentService and WebhookResource implementations are correct and working as designed.

You MUST modify the test file `src/test/java/villagecompute/calendar/api/rest/StripeWebhookControllerTest.java` to fix the transaction visibility issue:

### Solution: Add EntityManager.clear() and Fetch Fresh Data

After the webhook HTTP call completes, the test needs to ensure it's reading fresh data from the database, not cached entity state. Add the following changes:

1. **Inject EntityManager into the test class:**

```java
@Inject
EntityManager entityManager;
```

2. **After each webhook HTTP call that should update the database, clear the persistence context before querying:**

In `testWebhook_CheckoutSessionCompleted_UpdatesOrderStatus()` at line 265, replace:

```java
// Verify order updated to PAID (fetch fresh from DB)
order = CalendarOrder.findById(testOrder.id);
assertEquals(CalendarOrder.STATUS_PAID, order.status);
```

With:

```java
// Clear persistence context to ensure fresh read from database
entityManager.clear();

// Verify order updated to PAID (fetch fresh from DB)
order = CalendarOrder.findById(testOrder.id);
assertEquals(CalendarOrder.STATUS_PAID, order.status);
```

3. **Apply the same fix to ALL test methods that verify database changes after webhook calls:**

- `testWebhook_CheckoutSessionCompleted_UpdatesOrderStatus` (line ~267)
- `testWebhook_CheckoutSessionCompleted_EnqueuesEmailJob` (line ~312)
- `testWebhook_IdempotentProcessing_NoDuplicateUpdates` (line ~365 and ~383)
- `testWebhook_PaymentIntentSucceeded_UpdatesOrderStatus` (line ~448)
- `testWebhook_ChargeRefunded_UpdatesOrderNotes` (line ~515)
- `testWebhook_ChargeRefunded_IdempotentProcessing` (line ~572 and ~588)

### Why This Fix Works

- `EntityManager.clear()` detaches all managed entities from the persistence context
- Subsequent `CalendarOrder.findById()` calls will execute a fresh SELECT query against the database
- This ensures the test reads the committed transaction data from the webhook handler
- This pattern is standard for integration tests that verify database state changes via HTTP endpoints

### Important Notes

- **DO NOT** modify the PaymentService or WebhookResource implementations - they are correct
- The `@Transactional` annotation on the webhook endpoint is correct and must remain
- The test issue is a consequence of Quarkus transaction boundaries, not a bug in the production code
- Adding `entityManager.clear()` is a standard testing pattern for REST endpoint integration tests

### Alternative Solution (Less Preferred)

If EntityManager injection causes issues, you can use `QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew().run()` to wrap the verification code in a new transaction:

```java
// Verify order updated in a new transaction context
QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew().run(() -> {
    CalendarOrder order = CalendarOrder.findById(testOrder.id);
    assertEquals(CalendarOrder.STATUS_PAID, order.status);
    assertNotNull(order.paidAt);
    assertTrue(order.notes.contains("Payment succeeded"));
});
```

However, this approach is more verbose, so prefer the EntityManager.clear() solution.
